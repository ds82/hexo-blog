Yeah, well, a new blog engine again ;) It seems I definitly like it more to install and configure blog engines than acutally write blog posts. Well, doesn't matter as long as I'am having fun, right?

This time it's [hexo][hexo]. Hexo is a static site generator like [octopress], but instead of ruby it uses node.js <3

I found this simple theme based on bootstrap very nice. It's a [fork][hexo-theme-twbootstrap] of a [fork][pk-hexo-theme-ewal] by [Philipp Keller][philippkeller]. I improved a few things and created my own [fork][ds-hexo-theme-ewal] (love opensource <3).

My *new-blog-engine-resolutions*: 
 * write more blog posts ;)
 * write everything in vim. I'm still a big fan of Submlime Text, but improving my vim skills is very desirable.
